BFB Delivery: A Cruft Cutter
============================

Library and CLI for Bellingham Food Bank Delivery.

So far, you can use this package to cut some cruft around creating delivery route manifests:

    1. Split a driver-labeled route spreadsheet into individual driver spreadsheets. See :doc:`split_chunked_route` for more information.
    2. Create printable manifests. See :doc:`create_manifests_from_circuit` for more information.
