    This function takes the split chunked workbooks and mocks the CSVs returned by Circuit.

    After splitting the chunked route into multiple books with multiple driver sheets,
    the sheets are uploaded to Circuit. Circuit then returns the driver route tables
    as CSVs, one per driver.

    Args:
        split_chunked_sheet_paths: The paths to the split chunked route sheets.
        output_dir: The directory to write the mocked driver route tables to.

    Returns:
